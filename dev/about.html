                Hickory focuses on the bare minimum. We learn about your business and work with you to determine what will make the most impact. Then we get rid of all the extras, keeping your costs low and your focus on the important things. Depending on your needs, here are some services that Hickory might offer:

                <em>Why We Do It</em>
            </p>

            <p>
                Hickory Town Workshop was founded in the spring of 2015 to fill a void in the Lancaster community. There were plenty of web development and digital marketing outfits in the area, but they all focused on niche markets or well established businesses. That meant prices were too high for your small business. You could take the hit or try to manage everything yourself. But neither are great options.
            </p>

            <p>
                We aim to change that. Our goal is to partner with small, community-focused businesses and organizations to cultivate your online presence. No frills. No extras. Only the essentials. We don't have any one-size-fits-all options because we know everyone has different needs. Click the link below to see some of our solutions.
